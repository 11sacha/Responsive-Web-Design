      <h2>Welcome to your complete guide to documenting Python code. Whether you’re documenting a small script or a large project, whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned Pythonista, this guide will cover everything you need to know.</h3>

        <h3>Why Documenting Your Code Is So Important</h3>
        <p id="paragraph">Hopefully, if you’re reading this tutorial, you already know the importance of documenting your code. But if not, then let me quote something Guido mentioned to me at a recent PyCon:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p id="quote">“Code is more often read than written.” — Guido van Rossum</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p id="paragraph">When you write code, you write it for two primary audiences: your users and your developers (including yourself). Both audiences are equally important. If you’re like me, you’ve probably opened up old codebases and wondered to yourself, “What in the world was I thinking?” If you’re having a problem reading your own code, imagine what your users or other developers are experiencing when they’re trying to use or contribute to your code.</p>
        <p id="paragraph">Conversely, I’m sure you’ve run into a situation where you wanted to do something in Python and found what looks like a great library that can get the job done. However, when you start using the library, you look for examples, write-ups, or even official documentation on how to do something specific and can’t immediately find the solution.</p>
        <p>After searching, you come to realize that the documentation is lacking or even worse, missing entirely. This is a frustrating feeling that deters you from using the library, no matter how great or efficient the code is. Daniele Procida summarized this situation best:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p id="quote">“It doesn’t matter how good your software is, because if the documentation is not good enough, people will not use it.“ — Daniele Procida</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In this guide, you’ll learn from the ground up how to properly document your Python code from the smallest of scripts to the largest of <a href="https://realpython.com/intermediate-python-project-ideas/" target="_blank" class="link">Python projects</a> to help prevent your users from ever feeling too frustrated to use or contribute to your project.</p>

        <h3>Commenting vs Documenting Code</h3>
        <p>Before we can go into how to document your Python code, we need to distinguish documenting from commenting.</p>
        <p>In general, commenting is describing your code to/for developers. The intended main audience is the maintainers and developers of the Python code. In conjunction with well-written code, comments help to guide the reader to better understand your code and its purpose and design.</p>
        <p>Documenting code is describing its use and functionality to your users. While it may be helpful in the development process, the main intended audience is the users.</p>
        <h4 id="header_jr">Basics of Commenting Code</h4>
        <p>Comments are created in Python using the pound sign (#) and should be brief statements no longer than a few sentences. Here’s a simple example:</p>
        <div>
          <code id="code">def hello_world():
    # A simple comment preceding a simple print statement
    print("Hello World")</code>
        </div>
        <p>According to PEP 8, comments should have a maximum length of 72 characters. This is true even if your project changes the max line length to be greater than the recommended 80 characters. If a comment is going to be greater than the comment char limit, using multiple lines for the comment is appropriate:</p>
        <div>
          <code id="code">
     def hello_long_world():<br>
     # A very long statement that just goes on and on and on and on and<br>
     # never ends until after it's reached the 80 char limit<br>
     print("Hellooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo World")
          </code>
        </div>
        <h4 id="header_jr">Commenting Code via Type Hinting (Python 3.5+)</h4>
        <p>Type hinting was added to Python 3.5 and is an additional form to help the readers of your code.It allows the developer to design and explain portions of their code without commenting. Here’s a quick example:</p>
        <div>
          <code id="code">
            def hello_name(name: str) -> str:<br>
            return(f"Hello {name}")
          </code>
        </div>
        <p>From examining the type hinting, you can immediately tell that the function expects the input name to be of a type str, or string. You can also tell that the expected output of the function will be of a type str, or string, as well. While type hinting helps reduce comments, take into consideration that doing so may also make extra work when you are creating or updating your project documentation.</p>

        <h3>Documenting Your Python Code Base Using Docstrings</h3>
        <h4 id="header_jr">Docstrings Background</h4>
        <p>Documenting your Python code is all centered on docstrings. These are built-in strings that, when configured correctly, can help your users and yourself with your project’s documentation. Along with docstrings, Python also has the built-in function help() that prints out the objects docstring to the console. Here’s a quick example:</p>
        <div>
          <code id="code">
            >>> help(str)<br>
            Help on class str in module builtins:<br>
            class str(object)<br>
            |  str(object='') -> str<br>
            |  str(bytes_or_buffer[, encoding[, errors]]) -> str<br>
            |<br>
            |  Create a new string object from the given object. If encoding or<br>
            |  errors are specified, then the object must expose a data buffer<br>
            |  that will be decoded using the given encoding and error handler.<br>
            |  Otherwise, returns the result of object.__str__() (if defined)<br>
            |  or repr(object).<br>
            |  encoding defaults to sys.getdefaultencoding().<br>
            |  errors defaults to 'strict'.<br>
            # Truncated for readability<br>
          </code>
        </div>
        <p>How is this output generated? Since everything in Python is an object, you can examine the directory of the object using the dir() command. Let’s do that and see what find:</p>
        <div>
          <code id="code">
            >>> dir(str)<br>
            ['__add__', ..., '__doc__', ..., 'zfill'] # Truncated for readability
          </code>
        </div>
        <p>Within that directory output, there’s an interesting property, __doc__. If you examine that property, you’ll discover this:</p>
        <div>
          <code id="code">
            >>> print(str.__doc__)<br>
            str(object='') -> str<br>
            str(bytes_or_buffer[, encoding[, errors]]) -> str<br>
<br>
            Create a new string object from the given object. If encoding or<br>
            errors are specified, then the object must expose a data buffer<br>
            that will be decoded using the given encoding and error handler.<br>
            Otherwise, returns the result of object.__str__() (if defined)<br>
            or repr(object).<br>
            encoding defaults to sys.getdefaultencoding().<br>
            errors defaults to 'strict'.<br>
          </code>
        </div>
        <p>
          Python has one more feature that simplifies docstring creation. Instead of directly manipulating the __doc__ property, the strategic placement of the string literal directly below the object will automatically set the __doc__ value. Here’s what happens with the same example as above:
        </p>
        <div>
          <code id="code">
            >>> help(say_hello)<br>
            Help on function say_hello in module __main__:<br>
<br>
            say_hello(name)<br>
            A simple function that says hello... Richie style
          </code>
        </div>
        <p>There you go! Now you understand the background of docstrings. Now it’s time to learn about the different types of docstrings and what information they should contain.</p>
        <h4 id="header_jr">Docstring Types</h4>
        <p>Docstring conventions are described within <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/" target="_blank" class="link">PEP 257</a>. Their purpose is to provide your users with a brief overview of the object. They should be kept concise enough to be easy to maintain but still be elaborate enough for new users to understand their purpose and how to use the documented object.</p>
        <p>In all cases, the docstrings should use the triple-double quote (""") string format. This should be done whether the docstring is multi-lined or not. At a bare minimum, a docstring should be a quick summary of whatever is it you’re describing and should be contained within a single line:</p>
        <div>
          <code id="code">
            """This is a quick summary line used as a description of the object."""
          </code>
        </div>
        <p>Multi-lined docstrings are used to further elaborate on the object beyond the summary. All multi-lined docstrings have the following parts:</p>
        <ul id="unordered_list">
          <li>A one-line summary line</li>
          <li>A blank line proceeding the summary</li>
          <li>Any further elaboration for the docstring</li>
          <li>Another blank line</li>
        </ul>
        <div>
          <code id="code">
            """This is the summary line<br>

            This is the further elaboration of the docstring. Within this section,<br>
            you can elaborate further on details as appropriate for the situation.<br>
            Notice that the summary and the elaboration is separated by a blank new<br>
            line.<br>
            """<br>
<br>
            # Notice the blank line above. Code should continue on this line.
          </code>
        </div>
        <h4 id="header_jr">Docstring Formats</h4>
        <p>You may have noticed that, throughout the examples given in this tutorial, there has been specific formatting with common elements: Arguments, Returns, and Attributes. There are specific docstrings formats that can be used to help docstring parsers and users have a familiar and known format. The formatting used within the examples in this tutorial are NumPy/SciPy-style docstrings. Some of the most common formats are the following:</p>
        <ul id="unordered_lis">
          <li><a href="https://epydoc.sourceforge.net/epytext.html" target="_blank">Epytext</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html" target="_blank">reStructuredText</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html" target="_blank">NumPy/SciPy docstrings</a></li>

        <h3>Documenting Your Python Projects</h3>
        <p>Python projects come in all sorts of shapes, sizes, and purposes. The way you document your project should suit your specific situation. Keep in mind who the users of your project are going to be and adapt to their needs. Depending on the project type, certain aspects of documentation are recommended. The general layout of the project and its documentation should be as follows:</p>
        <div>
          <code id="code">
            project_root/<br>
            │<br>
            ├── project/  # Project source code<br>
            ├── docs/<br>
            ├── README<br>
            ├── HOW_TO_CONTRIBUTE<br>
            ├── CODE_OF_CONDUCT<br>
            ├── examples.py
          </code>
        </div>
        <p>Projects can be generally subdivided into three major types: Private, Shared, and Public/Open Source.</p>
        <h4 id="header_jr">Private Projects</h4>
        <p>Private projects are projects intended for personal use only and generally aren’t shared with other users or developers. Documentation can be pretty light on these types of projects. There are some recommended parts to add as needed:</p>
        <ul id="unordered_list">
          <li><strong>Readme:</strong> A brief summary of the project and its purpose. Include any special requirements for installation or operating the project.</li>
          <li><strong>examples.py:</strong> A Python script file that gives simple examples of how to use the project.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Remember, even though private projects are intended for you personally, you are also considered a user. Think about anything that may be confusing to you down the road and make sure to capture those in either comments, docstrings, or the readme.</p>
        <h4 id="header_jr">Shared Projects</h4>
        <p>Shared projects are projects in which you collaborate with a few other people in the development and/or use of the project. The “customer” or user of the project continues to be yourself and those limited few that use the project as well.</p>
        <p>Documentation should be a little more rigorous than it needs to be for a private project, mainly to help onboard new members to the project or alert contributors/users of new changes to the project. Some of the recommended parts to add to the project are the following:</p>
        <ul id="unordered_list">
          <li><strong>Readme:</strong> A brief summary of the project and its purpose. Include any special requirements for installing or operating the project. Additionally, add any major changes since the previous version.</li>
          <li><strong>examples.py:</strong> A Python script file that gives simple examples of how to use the projects.</li>
          <li><strong>How to Contribute:</strong> This should include how new contributors to the project can start contributing.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="header_jr">Public and Open Source Projects</h4>
        <p>Public and Open Source projects are projects that are intended to be shared with a large group of users and can involve large development teams. These projects should place as high of a priority on project documentation as the actual development of the project itself. Some of the recommended parts to add to the project are the following:
</p>
        <ul id="unordered_list">
          <li><strong>Readme:</strong> A brief summary of the project and its purpose. Include any special requirements for installing or operating the projects. Additionally, add any major changes since the previous version. Finally, add links to further documentation, bug reporting, and any other important information for the project. Dan Bader has put together a great tutorial on what all should be included in your readme.</li>
          <li><strong>How to Contribute:</strong> This should include how new contributors to the project can help. This includes developing new features, fixing known issues, adding documentation, adding new tests, or reporting issues.

</li>
          <li><strong>Code of Conduct:</strong> Defines how other contributors should treat each other when developing or using your software. This also states what will happen if this code is broken. If you’re using Github, a Code of Conduct template can be generated with recommended wording. For Open Source projects especially, consider adding this.</li>
          <li><strong>License:</strong> A plaintext file that describes the license your project is using. For Open Source projects especially, consider adding this.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the end, you want to make sure that your users have access to the answers to any questions they may have. By organizing your project in this manner, you’ll be able to answer those questions easily and in a format they’ll be able to navigate quickly.</p>

        <h3>Where Do I Start?</h3>
        <label>The documentation of projects have a simple progression:</label>
        <ol id="list">
          <li>No Documentation</li>
          <li>Some Documentation</li>
          <li>Complete Documentation</li>
          <li>Good Documentation</li>
          <li>Great Documentation</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you’re at a loss about where to go next with your documentation, look at where your project is now in relation to the progression above. Do you have any documentation? If not, then start there. If you have some documentation but are missing some of the key project files, get started by adding those.</p>
        <p>
          In the end, don’t get discouraged or overwhelmed by the amount of work required for documenting code. Once you get started documenting your code, it becomes easier to keep going.
